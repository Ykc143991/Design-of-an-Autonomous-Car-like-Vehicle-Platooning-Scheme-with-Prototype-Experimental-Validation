Design of an Autonomous Car-like Vehicle Platooning Scheme with Prototype Experimental Validation

Project Duration: Aug 2024 - Present

Guided by: Prof. Parijat Bhowmik (IIT Guwahati) | Robotics and Control Domain


Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and development of an autonomous vehicle platooning scheme, emulating a car-like formation using distributed control strategies. The goal is to implement robust control systems for both longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, ensuring safe and efficient vehicle platooning.

Key Contributions

Developed and implemented distributed control strategies for vehicle platooning, targeting both longitudinal and lateral control, using MATLAB, Simulink, ROS, and Gazebo.
Validated the platooning scheme through simulations and real-world experiments, utilizing TurtleBots (ROBOTIS) on a multi-robot test rig.
Focused on simulating and testing the vehicle's cooperative behavior and dynamic control, ensuring stability and safety in platooning scenarios.

Future Work

Addressing challenges related to static obstacle avoidance to improve the robustness of the system in dynamic environments.
Testing and refining cooperative control schemes for optimal formation control and further validation in real-world conditions.

Repository Status

As this is an ongoing project, files and updates will be uploaded progressively as they are completed and tested.
